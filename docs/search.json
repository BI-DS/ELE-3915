These are designed to be done immediately after watching the video.\n\nMake array constants using {...} Array constants are custom made arrays. They can be rows, columns, or two-dimensional. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nSelect rows or columns using numerical indexing with CHOOSEROWS and CHOOSECOLS. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nKeep or remove rows/columns with TAKE and DROP. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nManipulate array dimensions with TOROW and TOCOL. TOROW transforms an array into a row and TOCOLS transforms an array into a column. These are useful for presenting data and important when creating functions, as some functions such as FILTER do not always work as intended when applied to two-dimensional arrays. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nConstruct arrays with HSTACK and VSTACK. HSTACK stacks arrays horizontally and VSTACK stacks arrays vertically. These functions are especially handy when making functions. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nMake arrays more presentable with WRAPCOLS and WRAPROWS. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nMake formulas shorter with LET. The LET lets us define local variables, helping us reduce repetition in formulas. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nMake complex functions with LET. The LET function is especially useful when making functions. We’ll have a look at several examples. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nUse the INDIRECT function to turn text into references. This function is function is widely used, but has largely been supplanted by modern array functions. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nApplication: We define our own variant of the net present value function, called NPV in Excel. Links: Lecture notes and video.\nApplication: Summarizing tables with drop-down lists. Links: Lecture notes and video."
