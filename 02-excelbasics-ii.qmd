## Curriculum

### Absolute and relative references.

-   Know the difference between absolute, mixed, and relative references and when to use which.
-   Use F4 to cycle between the different kinds of references.

### Conditionals in Excel.

-   Conditional formulas
    -   `IF` function
    -   Oldskool nested `IF`
    -   The better `IFS` function
-   The `SUMIF`/`SUMIFS`; `COUNTIF`/`COUNTIFS`; `MINIFS`/`MAXIFS` functions.

### Working with text

-   Get an overview of the text manipulation functions in Excel and how to apply them.
-   Be able to solve basic text manipulation tasks.
-   Working with strings. Using `&` for concatenation and F9 for replacing formulas with values.
-   Not all useful text manipulation tools are built-in though. For instance, `WORDCOUNT`, counting the number of words in a text, does not exist. We will revisit text manipulation later on.
-   We will revisit text manipulation later on.
-   Some of the functions are oldskool. You might see them used, but modern alternatives are better.
    -   This is arguably the case for `LEFT`; `MID`, and `RIGHT`, `FIND` and `SEARCH`.
