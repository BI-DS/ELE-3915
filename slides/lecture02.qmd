## Absolute and relative references
* When you copy a formula in Excel the references in the formula change automatically.
* You can avoid this by dragging the formulas around.
* But you can also use absolute references.
* Absolute references have a `$` sign in front.
* Use F4 to cycle between the different kinds of references.

## Working with text
* We will cover oldskool text manipulation in this lecture. There are better options we'll get tot soon.
* You should expect to see oldskool text manipulation in Excel documents, but might not use it much yourself.
