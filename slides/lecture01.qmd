## Organization

-   I, Jonas Moss, am teaching the first half of the course.
-   My colleague Adam Lee is teaching the second half.
-   Planning on two guest lectures (not currently in the plan), one from Microsoft and one from a seasoned professional. We'll add them to the plan shortly.
-   We have two TAs right now, Stoyan and Zacky.
-   Remember this course is completely new! If something doesn't work, we'll have to change it.
-   I don't check It's learning often. Please send an e-mail if you need to get in contact with me.
-   Tell me if something doesn't work, e.g., you don't see what I'm doing.

## Excel versions

-   We will use both Excel on the Web and Excel 365 Desktop.
-   In this lecture, I will use the desktop version, but you can use the online version too, for now.
-   However, Power Query and the important Name Manager are only available on the desktop version.
-   Some TypeScript functionality is only available on Excel on the Web! (Notably, recording macros.)
-   I will use the desktop version.
-   Please bring your computer to the lectures.

## Locales

-   I will be using the Norwegian locale, where "0,0" is a decimal number. In the English locale, "0.0" is a decimal number.
-   This is important! It also affects formulas, as you must modify ';' to ','!
-   Your computer may be using the English locale. That's completely fine! Just use ',' where I use ';' and '.' where I use ','.
-   There are also Norwegian versions of Excel. Do not use them. They use different function names, e.g., GJENNOMSNITT instead of AVERAGE.
-   You may encounter the Norwegian version of Excel in your future job, so it might be useful to familiarize yourself with some of the Norwegian functions at some point. You can refer to [this list](https://easy-excel.com/excel-in-other-languages/excel-in-norwegian/). However, it is not on the curriculum and you cannot use Norwegian functions on the exam.

# Getting started

## Basic terminology

-   Cells and active cells.
-   Data entry
    -   Click on cell to modify
    -   Press ESC to ignore changes
-   Data types and blank cells
-   Formatting
-   Themes
-   Worksheets
-   Flash fill

## Arithmetic formulas

-   You can perform addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
-   To add two numbers `x` and `y`, use `=x+y`. To show the formula, prepend a `'`, i.e., `'=x+y`.
-   These operations can be combined, e.g. `=1+3*2`

## Logical formulas and comparison operators.

-   Comparison operators are used to compare numbers. They are:
    -   Equality: `=` (not `==`!).

    -   Strict inequality: `>`, and `<`.

    -   Inequalities: `>=`, and `<=`.
-   Logical operators: `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

## References

-   An Excel *reference* is a pointer to a cell on the worksheet.
-   Arithmetic and logical formulas can be used both with hard coded numbers and references.
-   For instance, you may write `=A1+B1`, where `A1` and `B1` are references to cells.

# Formuas

## `SUM` function

-   Use the `SUM` function to sum loads of numbers at once.
-   Blank cells at cells with text are ignored.

## Errors

-   If you write a formula incorrectly, you will see errors.
-   Hover over the warning sign to see an explanation of the errors.
-   Error messages are important because they help you debug your formulas!
-   Check out more error messages [here](https://exceljet.net/articles/excel-formula-errors).

## Types

-   Each cell in Excel has one of five types.
-   You can check the type with the `=TYPE` function.
    -   1: Number
    -   2: Text
    -   4: Logical value
    -   16: Error
    -   64: Dynamic array
    -   128: Compound data
-   Dynamic arrays will be covered later.
-   Two gotchas: Blank cells have the number type. Dates also have the number type!

## Basics of formulas

-   Using `=` to create formulas.
-   Use `TAB` for auto-complete.
-   You can read a short description of what the function does in its tooltip.
-   For examples and detailed explanation, Google the name of the function along with "ExcelJet".

## Functions

-   When writing a function name and a single parenthesis, you will see the arguments a function takes. This is called its *signature*.
-   Optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets \[\].
-   Ex: `=SUM(number1;[number2];...)` The `SUM` function has one mandatory `number1` argument and an arbitrary number of additional arguments `number2`, `number3`, etc.
-   Ranges: "Represents a cell, a row, a column, a selection of cells containing one or more contiguous blocks of cells, or a 3D range."
