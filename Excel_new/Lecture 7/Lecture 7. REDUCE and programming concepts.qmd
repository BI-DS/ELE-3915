## Curriculum

We cover the following:

- How to think about constructing complex functions: Break everything down into steps, make sure every step works, and combine.
- [`REDUCE`](https://exceljet.net/functions/let-function) to do similar operations over and over. `REDUCE` can be thought of as Excel's variant of the `for` loop in imperative programming languages such as Python and R. 
- The `MAP`-`FILTER`-`REDUCE` idiom and why it is useful.
