## Curriculum

We cover the following functions and idioms:

- [`LET`](https://exceljet.net/functions/let-function) to simplify formulas.
- [`LET`](https://exceljet.net/functions/let-function) to construct advanced functions.
- Using [`REDUCE`](https://exceljet.net/functions/reduce-function) to reduce data into one point.
- Applying the `MAP`-`FILTER`-`REDUCE` idiom for complex manipulations.
- Optional arguments with [`ISOMITTED`](https://exceljet.net/functions/isomitted-function).

In addition, we work with programming more complex functions, and with patterns
in programming.
