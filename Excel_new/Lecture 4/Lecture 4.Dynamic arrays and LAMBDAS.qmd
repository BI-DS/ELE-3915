## Curriculum

* [Dynamic arrays](https://exceljet.net/articles/dynamic-array-formulas-in-excel), including [array constants](https://exceljet.net/glossary/array-constant).
* [`CHOOSECOLS`](https://exceljet.net/functions/choosecols-function) and [`CHOOSEROWS`](https://exceljet.net/functions/chooserows-function) to select columns or rows. Can be used instead of INDEX to convey intent better.
* [`TAKE`](https://exceljet.net/functions/take-function) and [`DROP`](https://exceljet.net/functions/drop-function) for taking or dropping a certain number of elements from an array.
* Dynamic array GOTCHAS; not all functions work with dynamic arrays. In particular, dynamic arrays do not work with [`SUMIFS`](https://exceljet.net/functions/sumifs-function)-type functions. You need to use the `--x`- trick instead.
* The [`SEQUENCE`](https://exceljet.net/functions/sequence-function) function, used to create arrays of numbers such as `1,2,3,4`.
* Usage of the Excel labs add-in.
* Basics of [`LAMBDA`](https://exceljet.net/functions/lambda-function)s.
