We won't cover all of them in detail. Here is a list of particularly important functions.\n\n| Name                            | Description                                                                 |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| `ABS`                           | Find the absolute value of a number.                                        |\n| `EXP`                           | Find the value of e raised to the power of a number.                        |\n| `LOG`                           | Get the logarithm of a number.                                              |\n| `FLOOR.MATH`                    | Round number down to nearest multiple.                                      |\n| `CEILING.MATH`                  | Round a number up to nearest multiple.                                      |\n| `ROUND`                         | Round a number to a given number of digits.                                 |\n| `COMBIN`                        | Get number of combinations without repetitions.                             |\n| `MOD` / `QUOTIENT`              | Get the remainder from division / Returns the quotient without a remainder. |\n| `POWER` / `^` operator / `SQRT` | Raise a number to a power or calculate the square root.                     |\n\n-   Learn about how and when to use the `SUMPRODUCT` function.\n\n### Working with text\n\n-   Understand the use of the `&` operator for concatenation.\n-   Learn to solve basic text manipulation tasks.\n-   Get an overview of the text manipulation functions in Excel and how to apply them.\n\n| Name                       | Description                                         |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| `TRIM`                     | Remove extra spaces from text.                      |\n| `TEXTBEFORE` / `TEXTAFTER` | Extract text before / after delimiter.              |\n| `EXACT`                    | Compare two text strings, taking case into account. |\n| `SUBSTITUTE`               | Replace text based on content.                      |\n| `LOWER`/`UPPER`            | Transform text to lower/upper case.                 |\n| `PROPER`                   | Capitalize first letter of each word in text.       |\n| `CONCAT` / `TEXTJOIN`      | Join text values with(out) a delimiter.             |\n| `LEN`                      | Get the length of the text                          |\n| `LEFT` / `MID` / `RIGHT`   | Extract text from the left/middle/right of a string |\n| `FIND`                     | Get location substring in a string.                 |\n| `REPLACE`                  | Replace text based on location.                     |\n\n-   Note that not all useful text manipulation tools are built-in and some tasks, such as counting the number of words in a text, may require creating custom functions.\n-   Some of the functions are outdated. You will see them used, but modern alternatives are better. This is arguably the case for `LEFT`; `MID`, and `RIGHT`, `FIND` and `SEARCH`. The modern variants will be covered in later lectures.\n\n## Lectures and exercises\n\nThe Excel sheets used in the lecture, before being filled in, [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture02.xlsx). The lecture notes after being filled in are [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture02_solutions.xlsx). [Here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/exercises/exercises02.xlsx) are the exercises; the solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/exercises/exercises02_solutions.xlsx).\n\n## Recommended resources\n\nThe YouTuber [Chandoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thvE8Eg-Pqg&ab_channel=Chandoo) discusses the text manipulation functions at length, so does the YouTuber Leila Gharani [Leila Gharani](https://www.youtube.com/@LeilaGharani). There are many good videos about these topics, and I strongly encourage you to explore them.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"02-excelbasics-ii.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","editor":"visual","theme":"simplex"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"02-excelbasics-ii.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
