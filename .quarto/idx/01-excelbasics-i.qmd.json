Worksheets, basic formatting, data types and blank cells.\n\n-   Understanding what [formulas and functions](https://exceljet.net/articles/excel-formulas-and-functions) are, including copying of formulas using relative references.\n\n-   Reading the signature and short documentation of functions inside Excel.\n\n-   Using [flash fill](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/save-time-with-flash-fill-9159216a-75a0-4c11-82e6-8eca29cb3b89).\n\n-   Using the operators `+`,`-`,`/`, and `*`.\n\n-   A couple of keyboard shortcuts.\n\n    -   Press F2 to edit a cell and see its dependencies.\n\n    -   Press escape to exit editing a formula.\n\n    -   Press tab to auto-complete a formula.\n    \n    - Press SHIFT to add contiguous cells to a selection.\n    \n    - Press CTRL+DOWN to go to the last non-blank cell in a contiguous column. And CTRL+UP to go to the first column-wise, CTRL+LEFT-ARROW to go to the first row-wise, and CTRL+RIGHT-ARROW to go to the last row-wise.\n    \n    - Hold CTRL to add cells to a selection.\n    \n    - Press F4 to taggle absolute references.\n\n- Logical values; the functions `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and the operators `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=`.\n\n- Overview of [error messages](https://exceljet.net/articles/excel-formula-errors).\n\n- Knowledge of the basic datatypes of Excel (number; text; logical; error; array), including how to use the [`TYPE`](https://exceljet.net/functions/type-function#:~:text=The%20Excel%20TYPE%20function%20returns,value%20in%20a%20particular%20cell) function.\n\nBasic functions using one range as argument.\n\n| Name      | Description  |\n| --------- | ------------ |\n| [`SUM`](https://exceljet.net/functions/sum-function)     | Sum all numbers in a range.\n| [`PRODUCT`](https://exceljet.net/functions/product-function) | The product of all numbers in a range.\n| [`MAX`](https://exceljet.net/functions/max-function)     | The maximum of numbers in a range.\n| [`MIN`](https://exceljet.net/functions/min-function)     | The minimum of numbers in a range.\n| [`COUNT`](https://exceljet.net/functions/count-function)/[`COUNTA`](https://exceljet.net/functions/counta-function)/[`COUNTBLANK`](https://exceljet.net/functions/countblank-function)| Count the number of cells in a range that contain numbers (`COUNT`), are non-empty (`COUNTA`), or empty (`COUNTBLANK`).\n| [`ROWS`](https://exceljet.net/functions/rows-function) / [`COLS`](https://exceljet.net/functions/cols-function) | Counts the number of rows / columns in a reference.\n| [`AVERAGE`](https://exceljet.net/functions/average-function) | The average of the numbers in a range. Empty cells are ignored.\n| [`MEDIAN`](https://exceljet.net/functions/median-function)  | The median of the numbers in a range.\n| [`STDEV`](https://exceljet.net/functions/stdev-function) | The standard deviation of the numbers in a range. Empty cells are ignored.\n| [`COUNTIF`](https://exceljet.net/functions/countif-function) | Counts cells satisfying a criterion.\n\n## Slides and sheets used in the lecture\n::: {.warning}\nRemember to look at the solutions only after giving the exercises a serious attempt. Solve the exercises yourself after looking at the solution.\n:::\n\nThe lecture slides are [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/8fb93ac2fc77767f01d2afc605c9c9907f3022e8/slides/lecture01.html). The Excel sheets used in the lecture, before being filled in, [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture01.xlsx). The lecture notes after being filled in are [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture01-filled.xlsx).\n\n[Here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/exercises01.xlsx) are the exercises; the solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/exercises01-solutions.xlsx).\n\n\n## Recommended resources\nThere are many excellent video resources for Excel online. The content of this lecture is pretty standard stuff, and there are probably 100s of Youtube videoes covering essentially the same content. For instance, the formulas covered in this lecture are also covered by Kevin Stratvert [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0Qk63z2ZY&ab_channel=KevinStratvert), but he goes a little further, covering harder formulas too. Leila Gharani introduces formulas [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1126PQ5zRU&ab_channel=LeilaGharani).\n\nThere are many introductions to flash fill too, e.g. [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KimYFzET1w&ab_channel=LeilaGharani).\n\nThe site [Excel Exercises](https://excelexercises.com/) provides some decent exercises, but goes beyond the content of this lecture.\n\nThere is a staggering number of shortcuts in Excel, see e.g. [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/keyboard-shortcuts-in-excel-1798d9d5-842a-42b8-9c99-9b7213f0040f). It's easy to get overwhelmed by shortcuts, so make sure you don't try to learn too many at once though!"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"01-excelbasics-i.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"simplex"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"01-excelbasics-i.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
