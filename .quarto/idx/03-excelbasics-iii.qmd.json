This article contains more information than I went through in the lecture, and you should read it.\n-   We have a cursory look at conditional formatting and very basic charts. \n-   In addition, we consider basic use of data validation, i.e., making drop down lists.\n-   Ranking and ordering using `RANK.EQ`, `RANK.AVG`, `SORT`, and `SORTBY`. Knowledge of sorting using Excel buttons.\n\n## Lectures and exercises\n\nThe Excel sheets used in the lecture, before being filled in, [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture03.xlsx). The lecture notes after being filled in are [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture03_solutions.xlsx). [Here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/exercises/exercises03.xlsx) are the exercises; the solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/exercises/exercises03_solutions.xlsx).\n\n## Recommended resources\n\nThe [Wise Owl Training](https://www.wiseowl.co.uk/excel/exercises/standard/lookup-functions/) site has several exercises on lookup functions. They also have exercises covering other Excel topics. \n\nYou will be exposed to the function `VLOOKUP` outside of this course. It's worth it to spend some minutes understanding the difference between `XLOOKUP` and `VLOOKUP`, see e.g. [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXU7lsd0ftA).\n\nData validation and conditional formatting are bigger topics that it would seem from our coverage. You can read more about them on ExcelJet or elsewhere."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"03-excelbasics-iii.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"simplex"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"03-excelbasics-iii.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
