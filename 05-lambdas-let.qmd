## Functionality

### Make array constants using `{...}`
Array constants are custom made arrays. They be rows, columns, or two-dimensional.

### Keep or remove rows/columns with `TAKE` and `DROP`

### Select rows/columns `CHOOSEROWS` and `CHOOSECOLS`
`CHOOSEROWS` and `CHOOSECOLS` lets you subset an array using numerical indexing.

### Manipulate array dimensions with `TOROW` and `TOCOL`

`TOROW` transforms an array to a row and `TOCOLS` transforms an array to a column. These are useful for presenting data. They are important when creating functions, as some functions such as `FILTER` do not always work as intended when applied to two-dimensional arrays.

### Construct arrays with `HSTACK` and `VSTACK`
`HSTACK` stacks arrays horizontally and `VSTACK` stacks arrays vertically. These functions are especially handy when making functions.
