# Programming in Excel (iii): `REDUCE`, `SCAN`, and applications

## Curriculum

Excel is equipped with many functions for handling dynamic arrays and `LAMBDA` functions. The most important are `FILTER`, `MAP` (and its cousins `BYCOL`, `BYROW`, and `MAKEARRAY`), and the pair `REDUCE` and `SCAN`.

The `REDUCE` and `SCAN` functions are somewhat harder to understand than most of the functions covered until now, and we will spend some time explaining them.

We cover four functions in this lecture.

-   `OFFSET`, an function used to reference ranges. In most cases it's possible to use INDEX instead. [Lecture notes.](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture06/01_offset.xlsx)
-   `ISOMITTED` is used for optional arguments in `LAMBDA` functions. [Lecture notes.](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture06/02_optional_arguments.xlsx)
-   `REDUCE`. This is a difficult but exceedingly important function. Reduces an array into a single output. Generalizes `SUM` and `PRODUCT`. [Lecture notes.](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture06/03_reduce.xlsx)
-   `SCAN`. Reduces an array, but keeps the output for all consecutive subarrays. Generalizes the cumulative `SUM`.[Lecture notes.](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/slides/lecture06/05_scan.xlsx)

In addition, we cover the FILTER-MAP-REDUCE pattern. Most data analysis tasks can be done using a combination of `FILTER`, `MAP`, and `REDUCE/SCAN`, where array manipulation (e.g. `CHOOSEROWS` and `HSTACK`) and local variable (`LET`) are used as needed.

## Exercises

Most of the lecture notes above contain small exercises. I recommend you do them before attempting starting on the main exercise sheet. The main exercises are [here](https://github.com/BI-DS/ELE-3915/blob/main/exercises/exercises06.xlsx), with solution proposals included.
