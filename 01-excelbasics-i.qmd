## Recommended resources
There are many excellent video resources for Excel online. The content of this lecture is pretty standard stuff, and there are probably 100s of Youtube videoes covering essentially the same content. For instance, the formulas covered in this lecture are also covered by Kevin Stratvert [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl0Qk63z2ZY&ab_channel=KevinStratvert), but he goes a little further, covering harder formulas too. Leila Gharani introduces formulas [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1126PQ5zRU&ab_channel=LeilaGharani).
